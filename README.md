## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm **Dominik** and this is my personal GitHub account for my git repos. Here you can find my configs and projects I made.

### About me
- Cybersecurity student
- Programmer, technology minimalist
- Sports passionate
- Gamer (at least a shadow of what it used to be)

### My uses
For my main work, I run Linux:
- Distro -> Arch
- DE -> I use dwm, which is a window manager, not a DE.
- Terminal -> st
- Shell -> zsh
- VM -> simply default Kali with Xfce

And for games, I run Win11 (not dual-booting; they are separate machines)

### Contact
- [Email](mailto:dominik@dmpk.xyz)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominikpakula/) (I do **not** use it often)
