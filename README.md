## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm **Dominik** and this is my personal GitHub account for my git repos. Here you can find my configs and projects I made.

### About me
- ~~Cybersecurity~~ IT student (going back yessir)
- Programmer, technology minimalist
- Sports passionate
- Gamer (at least a shadow of what it used to be)

### My uses
For my main work, I run Linux:
- Distro -> Arch
- WM -> dwm
- Terminal -> st
- Shell -> zsh

I only have a machine with Win11, just in case.
